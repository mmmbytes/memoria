## Features

### Minimalist Design

Memoria's minimalist design philosophy ensures a clutter-free environment that allows you to focus solely on writing. Say goodbye to the distractions of formatting and design, as Memoria automatically transforms your words into a visually appealing, easy-to-read layout.

### Smart Tagging

Memoria's intelligent tagging system categorizes your notes automatically, helping you keep your thoughts organized and easy to find. You can also manually add your own tags, which will not only give you more control over your notes but also help the app refine its tagging capabilities.

Leveraging the power of the tagging system, Memoria's unique organizational approach reflects the true interconnectedness of our thoughts. Each note belongs to multiple families, enabling you to create diverse note collections tailored to your specific documentation needs.

## Technology

Memoria is being developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js), ensuring a robust and scalable foundation. As Memoria continues to evolve, additional layers may be incorporated to enhance its capabilities. We welcome your suggestions and ideas for potential stacks that could further enrich this application.
